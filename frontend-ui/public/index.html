          <p><b>In</b> recent years, there have been numerous cases involving the fatal shooting of Black Americans by the
            police. In majority of these cases, the police officers involved in the shooting were let off with a slap on
            the wrist leaving the victims’ families unsatisfied with the ruling.
          </p>
            <p>
              Based on this, we decided to conduct an analysis of police shooting incidents in America from 2015 to date, to
              ascertain if the shootings were justified in a bid to help victims and their families seeking justice to get
              it. To achieve this, we performed clustering technique on our data to discover patterns about police shootings
              that could help the victims and their families in their lawsuit against the police.
              Based on this, we decided to conduct an analysis of police shooting incidents in America from 2015 to date, to
              ascertain if the shootings were justified in a bid to help victims and their families seeking justice to get
              it. To achieve this, we used a supervised learning algorithm to predict the probability of a gunshot being
              ruled as unjustified. Cases with probabilities equal to or higher than 60% are most likely unjust. Hence, this
              approach could help the victims, their families as well as NGOs, in their lawsuit against accused police
              officer(s).

              The ‘shooting’ dataset contains data about people that have been shot and killed by the police from 2015 to
            2020 such as their name, age, gender and race. Additionally, information is provided about their date of
            shooting and where it happened, their mental state, if they posed any threat, if they had any weapon on them
            and if the police was wearing a body camera. You can access the dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings">here</a>.
